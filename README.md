# CurrencyConverter

This is a project that everyone in CIT 3606 can contribute to by making a branch and a Pull Request (PR).

1. Click on Code and open with Github Desktop or clone in another way to have your own local copy.
2. In Github Desktop, pull down Main branch and click on **New Branch**. A branch allows you to add a new feature without changing main until you are ready to merge the branch. Name your branch something like *add*-*YourName*-*YourCurrency*.
3. Add your currencies to the drop down select options in index.html, and add your rates to the JSON data exchangeRates data structure in script.js. Test. You can also make some style changes and any other suggested changes.
4. Test your local changes. Commit them to your branch and push/sync the branch.
5. In Github Desktop, pull down the Branch menu and click on **Create a Pull Request**. A pull request (PR) lets the owner(s) of the repo see the changes you are suggesting. This will take you to the github site, where you can click on Create Pull Request button. And click on the Settings gear to the right to request a **Review** from me. I will accept your PR after reviewing it.
